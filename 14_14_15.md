# Question 13: How do you list all Docker images?

**Introduction:**
"Today we’re diving into Docker images. Ever wondered how to see all the images you have locally? Let’s check it out!"

**Key Points:**

1. **Docker Images Basics**

   * Docker images are like templates for containers.
   * They include everything needed to run an app: code, libraries, and dependencies.
   * *(On-screen text: “Docker Image = App Template + Dependencies”)*
   * Diagram placeholder:

     ```mermaid
     graph TD
       Image["Docker Image"] --> Code["App Code"]
       Image --> Lib["Libraries"]
       Image --> OS["Base OS"]
     ```

2. **List All Images Command**

   * Use `docker images` or `docker image ls` to list images.
   * Shows IMAGE ID, TAG, SIZE, and CREATED date.
   * *(On-screen text: `docker images` → shows list)*
   * Diagram placeholder:

     ```mermaid
     graph LR
       Command["docker images"] --> Output["List of images with details"]
     ```

3. **Optional Filters**

   * Use `docker images -a` to see all images including intermediate layers.
   * Use `docker images <name>` to filter by image name.
   * *(On-screen text: `docker images -a` for all images)*

**Conclusion:**
"Listing Docker images is simple with `docker images`. Keep track of your local images to manage space and cleanup efficiently!"

# Question 14: How do you delete a Docker container?

**Introduction:**
"Next, let’s tackle Docker containers. Sometimes, you just want to remove a container. Here’s how!"

**Key Points:**

1. **Docker Container Basics**

   * Containers are running instances of images.
   * Each container is isolated and can be started, stopped, or deleted.
   * *(On-screen text: “Container = Running Image Instance”)*
   * Diagram placeholder:

     ```mermaid
     graph TD
       Image["Docker Image"] --> Container["Docker Container"]
     ```

2. **Stop a Running Container**

   * Command: `docker stop <container_id>`
   * Stops the container safely before deletion.
   * *(On-screen text: `docker stop <container_id>` → stops container)*

3. **Remove a Container**

   * Command: `docker rm <container_id>`
   * Removes container completely.
   * *(On-screen text: `docker rm <container_id>` → container deleted)*
   * Diagram placeholder:

     ```mermaid
     graph LR
       Container["Stopped Container"] --> Delete["docker rm"] --> Gone["Container Deleted"]
     ```

4. **Force Delete**

   * If container is running: `docker rm -f <container_id>`
   * Stops and deletes in one command.
   * *(On-screen text: `docker rm -f <container_id>` → forced removal)*

**Conclusion:**
"Deleting containers helps clean up your workspace. Always stop before deleting, or use `-f` for a quick force removal!"

---

# Question 15: How do you delete a Docker image?

**Introduction:**
"Finally, let’s remove Docker images. Images take space, so deleting unused ones is important."

**Key Points:**

1. **Why Delete Images?**

   * Free up disk space.
   * Remove old or outdated images.
   * *(On-screen text: “Clean Images = More Disk Space”)*

2. **Delete Image Command**

   * Command: `docker rmi <image_id>`
   * Removes the image from your local system.
   * *(On-screen text: `docker rmi <image_id>` → image deleted)*
   * Diagram placeholder:

     ```mermaid
     graph LR
       Image["Docker Image"] --> Delete["docker rmi"] --> Gone["Image Deleted"]
     ```

3. **Force Delete**

   * Use `docker rmi -f <image_id>` if image is in use by containers.
   * *(On-screen text: `docker rmi -f <image_id>` → force deletion)*

4. **Remove Multiple Images**

   * Can delete multiple images in one command: `docker rmi <id1> <id2>`.
   * *(On-screen text: “docker rmi id1 id2 …”)*

**Conclusion:**
"Deleting images keeps your Docker environment clean. Remember, check containers first — you can’t delete images that are in use!"

Perfect! Let's start with the **first video** from your JSON object:

**Video 1:** 📦 List All Docker Images Easily!

Here’s a full, natural, conversational **voiceover script** following your instructions:

---

**[Intro – Grab Attention]**
Hey! Have you ever wondered **what Docker images you have** on your system? [pause]
Sometimes, they pile up and we don’t even realize it. [pause]
Today, I’ll show you a **super simple way** to see them all. [pause]

**[Explanation Begins]**
First, let’s quickly understand what a **Docker image** is. [pause]
Think of it like a **recipe** for an app. [pause]
It contains the code, libraries, and everything the app needs to run. [pause]
So, whenever you start a container, it’s like **cooking the recipe**. [pause]

Now, to see all your images, you use this command: **docker images**. [pause]
Look at this part… it shows **IMAGE ID, TAG, SIZE, and CREATED date**. [pause]
Pretty simple, right? [pause]

If you want to see **all images including intermediate ones**, use **docker images -a**. [pause]
And here’s a trick — if you remember a name, you can filter like this: **docker images <name>**. [pause]
This helps a lot when you have many images stored. [pause]

See how organized this is? [pause]
Now you can easily manage space and know exactly what’s on your system. [pause]

**[Visual Reference]**
As you can see here, the list shows each image and its **details clearly**. [pause]
You can spot old or unused images right away. [pause]

**[Practical Tip]**
Pro tip: regularly check your images, especially when experimenting with new apps. [pause]
It saves **disk space** and avoids confusion later. [pause]

**[Closing – Call to Action]**
So, that’s it! [pause]
**List your Docker images**, keep your system clean, and stay organized. [pause]
If this helped you, **hit like** and **subscribe** for more simple Docker tips. [pause]
Thanks for watching! [pause]

**[Intro – Grab Attention]**
Hey! Have you ever tried deleting a Docker container and it didn’t work? [pause]
It happens a lot! [pause]
Today, I’ll show you the **easy way to remove containers safely**. [pause]

**[Explanation Begins]**
First, let’s understand what a **Docker container** is. [pause]
It’s basically a **running instance of a Docker image**. [pause]
Think of it like a **mini-app running on your system**, isolated from everything else. [pause]

Now, before deleting, if your container is running, you need to **stop it first**. [pause]
Use this command: **docker stop <container_id>**. [pause]
See this part… it safely stops the container without causing errors. [pause]

Once it’s stopped, you can **remove it completely** with: **docker rm <container_id>**. [pause]
Look at this! [pause]
The container disappears from your list, and your workspace is cleaner. [pause]

Sometimes, a container is still running or stuck. [pause]
In that case, use **docker rm -f <container_id>** to force delete. [pause]
It stops and deletes the container in one step. [pause]

**[Visual Reference]**
As you can see here, the stopped container is gone from the list. [pause]
This keeps your Docker environment neat and **easy to manage**. [pause]

**[Practical Tip]**
Pro tip: **always stop first**, unless you’re sure force deletion is safe. [pause]
It avoids **accidental data loss** and keeps things smooth. [pause]

**[Closing – Call to Action]**
And that’s it! [pause]
**Stop and delete containers** like a pro, and keep your workspace organized. [pause]
If this tip helped, **hit like** and **subscribe** for more quick Docker tricks. [pause]
Thanks for watching! [pause]

Next, I can create the **third video script** for:

**Video 3:** ❌ Delete Docker Images Safely!

Do you want me to do that now?



Great! Here’s the full **voiceover script** for **Video 3: ❌ Delete Docker Images Safely!**

---

**[Intro – Grab Attention]**
Hey! Have you ever seen your Docker images pile up and wondered… [pause]
“How do I safely remove them?” [pause]
Today, I’ll show you the **quick way to delete Docker images** without mistakes. [pause]

**[Explanation Begins]**
First, let’s understand why deleting images matters. [pause]
Unused images take **disk space** and make your workspace messy. [pause]
Think of them like old files you never open but keep storing. [pause]

To delete an image, the basic command is: **docker rmi <image_id>**. [pause]
Look at this part… it removes the image from your system completely. [pause]

But sometimes, the image is still used by a container. [pause]
In that case, you can use **docker rmi -f <image_id>** to force delete. [pause]
It stops any conflicts and cleans the image in one step. [pause]

You can also delete multiple images at once: **docker rmi <id1> <id2> …** [pause]
This is handy when experimenting with many images during projects. [pause]

**[Visual Reference]**
As you can see here, after deletion, the list is **clean and organized**. [pause]
No more old images taking up space! [pause]

**[Practical Tip]**
Pro tip: always **check which containers are using the image** before deleting. [pause]
This prevents accidental removal of important data. [pause]

**[Closing – Call to Action]**
And that’s it! [pause]
**Delete your Docker images safely** and keep your system clutter-free. [pause]
