You said:
after the hooks generated then how can i generated the questions
ChatGPT said:
Great question 🙌

Here’s a step-by-step way you can turn your viral YouTube Shorts hooks into strong interview Q&A questions (so you don’t get stuck after generating only the hooks):

🔑 Step 1: Start From the Hook
Take your killer hook (e.g., “Never answer this interview question like this…”).
Ask: What specific interview question does this hook relate to?

👉 Example:
Hook → “Never answer this interview question like this…”
Question → “Tell me about yourself.”

🔑 Step 2: Use Common Interview Question Categories
You can map hooks to high-frequency interview questions, such as:

Introductory: “Tell me about yourself”

Behavioral: “What’s your biggest weakness?”

Situational: “How would you handle conflict at work?”

Motivational: “Why do you want this job?”

Competency-based: “Describe a time you led a team.”

So if your hook is about pitfalls, pick from these categories and highlight the most common mistakes.

🔑 Step 3: Frame It Into Problem > Solution > Quick Tip
Once you have the question:

Problem (the hook) → Show the wrong way candidates usually answer.

Solution (the fix) → Give a clear, correct approach.

Quick Tip (sticky memory) → Drop a memorable tip (like a keyword formula, e.g., STAR method).

🔑 Step 4: Generate Questions Automatically
You can also build a prompt template to generate multiple questions per hook. For example:

Take this hook: [INSERT HOOK]  
→ Suggest 3 interview questions that best fit this hook.  
→ For each question, give the most common mistake candidates make and a short winning strategy.  
That way, you can always expand hooks into practical, question-based Shorts.

⚡ Example in Action:

Hook: “If you answer this in under 10 seconds, you’re failing…”

Questions generated:

“Why do you want this job?” → Pitfall: Giving generic answers → Solution: Tie skills to company’s mission.

“What are your strengths?” → Pitfall: Listing random traits → Solution: Back with examples.

“Where do you see yourself in 5 years?” → Pitfall: Saying “I don’t know” → Solution: Show growth aligned with role.

👉 Do you want me to take one of your hooks and demonstrate how to generate the matching interview questions + pitfalls + fixes so you can see it in practice?
